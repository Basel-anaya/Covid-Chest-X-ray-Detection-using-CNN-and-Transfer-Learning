### To use the model
1. `Clone` the repository:
``` git
git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid-chest-xray-detection.git
```
2. Install the required packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
``` git
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
3. Open a `terminal` and navigate to the cloned repository:
``` bash
cd covid-chest-xray-detection/

```
4. Run the `Streamlit` app:
``` 
streamlit run app.py
```
5. The app should open in a web browser. Click on the "Use Test X-ray Images" button and choose an image of a chest X-ray that you want to classify as either Covid, Virus or Normal.

6. The app will display the predicted class label (i.e., Covid, Virus or Normal).

7. You can upload additional images and make predictions as many times as you like.

> Note:

* If you encounter any issues, please make sure that you have installed all the `required packages` and that your Python environment is set up correctly.
* You can also modify the code in `app.py` to add new features or to customize the app according to your needs.
